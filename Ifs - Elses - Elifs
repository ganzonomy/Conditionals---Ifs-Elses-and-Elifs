## Here you will see my first programs in Python using Conditional Tests!

age = 23
if age >= 21:
    print("Have a Drink On Me!")
elif (age >= 18) and (age < 21):
    print ("Come in, but NO DRINKING")
else:
    print ("Go Home and Have a Glass of Almond Milk")
    
Have a Drink On Me!

## I know this is a very simple program, but it is growth from simply writing out variables.  Let's make another one!

Album = "Red"
Year = 1974
if (Album == "Red") and (Year == 1974):
    print ("Best Album Ever by King Crimson!")
elif (Album != "Red") and (Year == 1974):
    print ("Maybe it's Starless and Bible Black")
elif (Album == "Red") and (Year != 1974):
    print ("Maybe your Music Library Needs to be fixed")
else:
    print("Go Straight to the Court of the Crimson King")
    
Best Album Ever by King Crimson!

## And another program.  Also simple, but with different Variables for Album and Year.  This shows that the program tests both parameters
before it prints out its result.

Album = "THRAK"
Year = 1995
if (Album == "Red") and (Year == 1974):
    print ("Best Album Ever by King Crimson!")
elif (Album != "Red") and (Year == 1974):
    print ("Maybe it's Starless and Bible Black")
elif (Album == "Red") and (Year != 1974):
    print ("Maybe your Music Library Needs to be fixed")
else:
    print("Go Straight to the Court of the Crimson King")
    
Go Straight to the Court of the Crimson King
